Deliverable Specific Content
The deliverable was to use IBM Bob with the skills we had learned during the various presentations to produce a proof of concept of something we chose. 

During my time at the virtual event I decided to prioritize going to most of the lectures that were offered to learn more about how to use something like IBM bob and how normal
people at IBM make use of IBM Bob. I did not have much time after the presentations wtih my schedule so I decided to use IBM Bob to make a simple PST -> EST and EST -> PST time
zone converter. When the program is run it opens up a window and you input the current time and whether you want time zone you want it to be changed to. Due to concerns on my part with how we had to go through reigstering and requesting access for IBM Bob I have decided to not make the code file visible. This is to make sure that I am not leaking any information or usage of IBM Bob that the event did not want us sharing, as we had to submit all of the files we made using Bob to the event staff.

Screenshots of the various lectures I attended are attached below as well as screenshots of the program I made using Bob
